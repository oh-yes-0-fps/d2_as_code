# d2_as_code
This is a project dedicated to simulating the effects of perks in destiny 2 through programming,
Goal is to support Js, Python, C#, Java, C++, C, Rust and maybe lua submissions(haven't gotten around to templates yet).

As a note i will use these in my rust wasm web app im developing but anyone will be able to use these and the goal is to better the tools this community has
